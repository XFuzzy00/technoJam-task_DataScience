# technoJam-task_DataScience And technoJam-task_WebDevelopment
## A submission for the TechnoJam tasks.

### Data Science
##### Approach : I learned pip to install the required libraries.
#####            I imported the required libraries and learned the new functions available in pandas library.
#####            The blog was good and detailed so further more I followed the instructions given.
           
##### Challenges : Difficult to find good explanations for a lot of pandas library functions.
#####              Working on a new IDE (PyCharm) I got to learn new things and experienced little difficulty.
             
### Web Development
##### Approach : I designed a layout in Figma (Prototyping Software) and coded the website in Visual Studio with Figma as reference.
#####            Took some inspiration from websites such as [Spotify](https://www.spotify.com/in-en/) or [Resso](https://www.resso.app/in) that have minimilist yet impactful designs.
   
##### Challenges : Had to learn Grid System from bottom up because I am used to Flex Box but I wanted to try and learn some new things.
#####              The ::after selector was complicated yet the most used or useful tool in the above project. It made the program a bit interactive.
